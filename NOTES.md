Pomodoro 1:
First we spent some time reading the exercise and understanding what we have to do.
Then we tried to add a pre-commit hook for conventional commit messages to the cookie cutter.
We eventually gave up on this because we couldn't get it to work and we did not want to spend
too much time on it.
We used ChatGPT, Google and our own knowledge to try to get it to work.

Pomodoro 2:
We set up the mars rover code. Then we added the required document files.
Then we created our high-level plan in BACKLOG.md.

Pomodoro 3:
Initially we wanted to set up a Github Actions pipeline. 
But when we tried to run the code we ran into problems with JDKs.
We solved those and then read the mars rover assignment in detail.
Unfortunately we couldn't find the code for the mars rover project so we had to spend some time finding out where it is.

Pomodoro 4:
Identify code smells.
